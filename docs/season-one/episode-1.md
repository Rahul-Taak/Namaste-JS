# Episode 1: How JavaScript Works!

Let’s break down what happens behind the scenes when JavaScript runs 👇

---

## 🧠 Execution Context  
Think of this as the environment or box where your code runs.  
It’s made up of **two main parts**:  
1. **Memory Component** (also called *Variable Environment*)  
2. **Code Component** (also called *Thread of Execution*)

---

## 🗂️ Memory Component  
- This is where **all variables and functions are stored** before the code starts running.  
- It works like a big storage box using **key-value pairs**.

---

## 🧾 Code Component 
- This is where the code **executes line by line**.  
- Think of it like a conveyor belt — one line is picked up, executed, and then it moves to the next.

---

## ⚙️ JavaScript's Nature  
- 📍 **Synchronous** – Executes one task at a time, in order.  
- 🧵 **Single-threaded** – Can handle only one operation at a time.  
It **waits** until the current task finishes before moving to the next one.
